# Parallel-BruteForcer-SHA-256
Parallelized Brute-Force Decryption of  SHA-256 Hashed Passwords

# ABSTRACT: 
In today‚Äôs cyber security space, cryptographic practices are of utmost importance to ensure the integrity and security of sensitive information. The scope of this project is to improve the speed of this brute force attack by parallelizing the brute forced check by using a multi core architecture processor. This project can be deployed as a cross platform executable with multiple arguments which makes it a perfect tool for using in network penetration testing and password strength measurements. This project can also check for the fallacies in the provided hash by finding the possible collisions and recommending better security measures and prevention methodologies. The scope of this project can be further extended to a distributed approach where multiple distributed system clusters or a botnet of systems can be used in a distributed mode to crack the hash more efficiently, thereby enabling testing in a more realistic environment. 

The data being used in the project will be hash strings and the algorithm uses a brute force approach to decipher the plaintext from the hash. The acuity of the algorithm increases with the number of cores in the system and their clock frequencies. As this is a brute force algorithm, the performance metric which can be measured will be the time complexity to crack a hash of length ùëõ and plaintext of length ùëö. This will yield a time complexity of (ùëõùëö), which the project tries to reduce significantly.

# PROBLEM STATEMENT: 
Enterprises use cryptographic hash functions to securely store data like passwords etc. Password strengths can be weak or strong and to calculate that only length and types of characters used are being considered. This project tries to brute force the password back into plaintext. Traditional brute force has extremely high time complexity. A parallelized approach to this problem, will yield in a scenario where time complexity of brute forcing MD5 and SHA-1 becomes low. 

# INTRODUCTION: 
The term cryptography refers to techniques of making data indecipherable or cryptic by anyone except the official recipient in the event that the message is intercepted by someone else. One of the secure ways to store passwords in a database is to store them after passing them through a one way encryption or hashing algorithm which is almost impossible to decrypt without a brute force approach for which the time complexity is extremely high. A solid password storage strategy is necessary to justifying data breaches that put the reputation of any organization in danger. Hashing is the groundwork of secure password storage. One of these algorithms used for hashing / one-way encryption is called the MD5 ‚Äì Message Digest Algorithm which produces a unique 128bit hash string for every input.

Another algorithm is called the SHA-1 ‚Äì Secure Hash Algorithm which is a cryptographic hash function that takes an input and produces a 160-bit (20-byte) hash value known as a message digest. SHA-1 has not been considered secure against well-funded opponents. The scope of this project is to improve the speed of this brute force attack by parallelizing the brute forced check by using a multi core architecture processor. Multicore architecture places multiple processor cores and combines them together as a single physical processor. The concept of multicore technology is mainly focused on the possibility of parallel computing, which can boost computer speed and efficiency by including two or more central processing units (CPUs) in a single chip. This helps reduce the system's heat and power consumption which means much better performance with less or the same amount of energy. As this is a brute force algorithm, the performance metric which can be measured will be the time complexity to crack a hash of length ùëõ and plaintext of length ùëö. This will yield a time complexity of (ùëõùëö), which the project tries to reduce significantly.

# CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK:
We can conclude that this parallelized brute force decryption of SHA256 hashed passwords is significantly faster than serial algorithms doing the same.The performance is dependent on the length, character set of the original plaintext.In future versions, more algorithms can be added to this tool as to facilitate its brute-forced cracking.
Improvisation and smart optimizations in the task decomposition can also reduce the time complexity of the system.
